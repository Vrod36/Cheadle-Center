# Abstract


 Bees are around us everyday, yet we don’t truly understand them beyond the famous Honey Bee or Bumble Bee. With climate becoming rapidly inconsistent, we are fighting to gain the knowledge of how this phenomenon interacts with a bee’s ability to tolerate temperature (CTmin/CTmax). We conducted thermal tolerance assays on 170 bees in Santa Barbara and the Sierra Nevadas from many different generas, with a focus on Elevation. Within our tests, other variables were also taken into account for accuracy, such as Wet Mass, Duration spent in Vials, and Body Size. Our linear regression models have portrayed that the most significant variable towards a bee’s critical thermal minimum (CTmin). With a p-value of 0.001, the model shows that as elevation increases the CTmin of a bee will decrease. This means that bees living in higher elevations are more resistant to cold temperatures. We have also found that the heat tolerance of bees is surprisingly consistent among all variables. Through this project, our hope is that further research is done towards understanding the complexities of a relationship between bees and temperature change.
